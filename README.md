Credit Scoring Model

Develop a credit scoring model to predict the
creditworthiness of individuals based on historical
financial data. Utilize classification algorithms and
assess the model's accuracy. 

You can run the code in Pycharm and vscode.

I divided the task into following things:

Importing libraries:

pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: Provides support for large arrays and matrices.

matplotlib.pyplot: Used for plotting and visualization.

sklearn.model_selection: Includes tools for splitting the dataset and performing grid search.

sklearn.pipeline: Helps in creating a machine learning pipeline.

sklearn.compose: Allows combining different preprocessing steps.

sklearn.preprocessing: Contains various preprocessing utilities.

sklearn.linear_model: Provides regression algorithms like Ridge regression.

sklearn.metrics: Offers metrics for model evaluation.
